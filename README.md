# Fetal Health Classification

## Overview
This project aims to predict fetal health status using various machine learning models. The dataset contains records of fetal health measurements, and the goal is to classify the health status into three categories: normal, suspect, and pathologic. 

The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The Fetal Health Classification dataset contains 2,126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram (CTG) exams. These features were classified by three expert obstetricians into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological. The dataset aims to support the development of models that can classify fetal health, helping to prevent child and maternal mortality.

## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Results
The test accuracy results for the models are as follows:

- Gradient Boosting: 96.00%
- Random Forest: 95.00%
- Decision Tree: 93.00%
- Logistic Regression: 89.00%

Ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest performed the best, indicating strong predictive power on unseen data compared to simpler models like Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
